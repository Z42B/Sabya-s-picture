					<h3>Smokey mountains</h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The Smokey Mountains is one of my family's favorite places to see. The fog doesn't make the mountain so clear so the best way to see it is on the mountain! It is a very beutiful drive on and down the mountain with many pause points to look ant the view!</p>
